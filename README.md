# Rink

Rink is a unit-aware calculator. It can be used for physics and
engineering calculations, as well as dimensionality analysis.

Rink supports most systems of measurements including SI, CGS, natural,
international customary, US customary, UK customary, as well as
historical measurements. In addition, Rink supports currency
conversions.

Unique features:

- High-precision bignum rational arithmetic
- Detailed error messages
- Shows SI physical quantities
- Finds applicable SI derived units automatically
- Helps with dimensionality analysis, such as by offering unit
  factorizations and finding units for quantities.
- Open source
- First-class support for non-absolute temperature scales

## [Manual](https://github.com/tiffany352/rink-rs/wiki/Rink-Manual)

Describes (hopefully) everything you need to know to use Rink's
expression language.

## [Web Interface](https://tiffnix.com/rink/)

Rink is available via the web, so that you don't have to install it.

## Install

`cargo install rink`

Running `rink` will give you a CLI interface for you to enter queries.

## Examples

```
> kWh/year -> W
0.1140795 watt (power)
```

```
> W -> J
Conformance error: 1 watt (power) != 1 joule (energy)
Suggestions: multiply left side by time, multiply right side by frequency
```

```
> gallon gasoline -> kWh
approx. 36.63388 kWh (energy)
```

```
> googol^100
1.0e10000 (dimensionless)
```

## Library Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rink = "0.4"
```

and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate rink;
```

### 0.3.2
- Time quantities now automatically display in human units (year,
  week, day, hour, minute, second)
- Currency conversions sourced from the European Central Bank, and the
  BTC-E bitcoin exchange
- Move all element units from being dimensionless to being g/mol
  (molar mass)

  precedence
